# README Generator
https://github.com/Laura-Waters/README_generator

## Description

This JavaScript file can be used to gather user input and generate a README.md file. 

## Installation

Node.js and the Inquirer npm package should be installed for use. 

## Usage

Open the index.js file in a Terminal. Input 'node index' in the command line to generate the prompts. Once all responses have been inputted, you should see 'Success!' logged in the console. A README file that contains your responses should be generated. A badge that displays the repo's license will be included at the top of the page, the Table of Contents will allow you to move dynamically through the page, and the GitHub and email links at the bottom of the page will be live.
